Game Concept - Some kind of Program that uses a tile engine - no good ideas yet
				Maybe introducing users to what a tile engine is through a character



Engine Design
	Render and Input Loop
		Monogame handles in methods INITIALIZE, LOAD CONTENT, UPDATE (INPUT AND OBJECT STATE UPDATES), DRAW (RENDERING ROUTINE)

	Game Core
		Self-Implementation: Manages mundane tasks
			StateManager
				Handles all in game states using a stack
			ProcessManager
				Handles all in game processes (input, object state updates)
			Sub-Process Stack
				Can add sub game processes to a Process and have top of stack executed and popped necessarily 
				(e.g. to show a message box on a core game loop)
			Sub-Process Queue
				Can add sub game processes to a Process which all gets executed serially
				(e.g. A.I, network processing)

	Game States and Processors
		GameMenu
		GameCore
		GameMessageBox

	Tile World Design
		Isometric 2.5D
		Pseudo Height
		Multi-Layering Support (Base, Height, Skins, Multi-Tile Size)
		Animated Tile Support
		Loadable through text data - no compile
			INI based design with extension
				sections
					key values
					duplicate key support
					comments, start with (; #) and trailing (;)

	Input and Feedback
		Keyboard manager
		Mouse manager
			Click picking coordinates
			Drag and Drop Support

	Events and Entities Control
		Interpreter based Scripting Language for scalability (no need to recompile main program)

	Language and Fonts
		SpriteFont for Japanese Text
		Localization in Japanese Support
