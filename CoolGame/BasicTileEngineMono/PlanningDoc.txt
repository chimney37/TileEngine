Game Concept - Some kind of Program that uses a tile engine - no good ideas yet
				Maybe introducing users to what a tile engine is through a character



Design
	Render and Input Loop
		Monogame handles in methods INITIALIZE, LOAD CONTENT, UPDATE (INPUT AND OBJECT STATE UPDATES), DRAW (RENDERING ROUTINE)

	Game Core
		Self-Implementation: Manages mundane tasks
			StateManager
				Handles all in game states using a stack
			ProcessManager
				Handles all in game processes (input, object state updates)

	Game States
		MenuScreen
		GameScreen
	Tile World Generation
		Through Text File Maybe
	Events and Characters
		Interpreter based Scripting Language for scalability (no need to recompile main program)
